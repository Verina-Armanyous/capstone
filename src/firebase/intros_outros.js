In this module, we debunk common misconceptions related to the world map that affect our understanding of the world.",

        text: "Why does this matter, you may ask? Mercator's map reinforces imperialist views as it exaggerates the size of aged imperialist power and shrinks other countries and continents like Africa and South America, and that in turn shapes the perception of power around the world as humans unconsciously equate size with power and importance. Even the Gall-Peters Projection shown earlier, although it shows the correct sizes of countries, it distorts the shape. No flat map of the world can be perfect as distortion is bound to happen, but it is good to be aware of how they influence our world perceptions. Check out this video from West Wing that discusses the consequences of using Mercator's map.",
