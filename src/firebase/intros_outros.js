Mercator's map reinforces imperialist views as it exaggerates the size of aged imperialist power and shrinks other countries and continents like Africa and South America, and that in turn shapes the perception of power around the world as humans equate size with power and importance. Think about how the widespread use of this map at school, work, and everywhere can influence our world perceptions and what we can do to combat this.",
